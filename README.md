# DeafConnect

DeafConnect is a mobile application developed to facilitate communication for deaf individuals, empowering them to interact more effectively with their environment. The app utilizes various features including text-to-speech, speech-to-text translations, and text-to-sign language translation through an animated avatar. Additionally, it incorporates real-time speech-to-text translation by detecting American Sign Language (ASL) letters using deep learning techniques.
